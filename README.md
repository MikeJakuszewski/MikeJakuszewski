## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mike

I currently:
- work for OPISystems
- architect and build full stack applications
- explore AI and emerging tech
- optimize performance in React applications
- collaborate with teams on challenging projects

I'm driven by building things that matter. My approach to development combines technical precision with creative problem-solving. Whether it's crafting clean code or architecting scalable solutions, I'm always pushing to improve and learn. I believe great software comes from understanding both the technical requirements and the human experience.

Outside of coding, I find clarity through travel and nature exploration. There's something about being outdoors that brings fresh perspective to problem-solving in tech. I'm also deeply interested in AI advancements and their potential to transform how we build software. My hobbies include rock climbing, snowboarding, rollerblading, working out, and watching anime.
